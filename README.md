<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- 
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->

LNbits a free and open-source lightning wallet that offers a lot of extension. 
LNbits can run on any lightning-network funding source, currently supporting LND, c-lightning, OpenNode, lntxbot, LNPay and even LNbits itself!

You can run LNbits for yourself, or easily take the service from LNBits.

Each wallet has its own API keys and there is no limit to the number of wallets you can make.

Extensions add extra functionality to LNbits so it is possible to experiment with a range of cutting-edge technologies on the lightning network. One of the extension ist LNURL-withdraw.

You can generate LNURL-withdraw links wich are also available in form of QR-Codes. With this QR-Codes every wallet that supports LNURL-withdraw can remain the amount which is defined.

Generating vouchers in large quantities by the GUI is painful. Therefore you can use this script.




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

   ```
2. Install Pyhton Packages:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
### Usage
Setup an LNBits Wallet and configure the script using .env file or environment variables.
You have to config the access to the wallet and the access to a Mailbox. We use a GMail Account to send the responses.
