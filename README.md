<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- 
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->
During Lightning Workshops we often use a faucet to give the participants some satoshis to play around with.

There are other possibility to do that with LNURL-withdraw QR-Codes. But we recognized that it is better to first only use the protocol layer when explaining the lightning network.
Therefore we decided to use a faucet which can pay invoices directly.

We use Alby Wallet as a backend for the faucet. 

You can also use LNBits as a backend. Currently you can use Tag 0.1.0 for that. Or work on the Branch feature-lnbits.

In addition an e-mail address is required to check the invoices which are send to you.
To send back a respone e-mail we use the GMail API. This is also configurable in the .env file. Not using the GMail API is also possible. 
You can also use your SMTP Server. We use GMail API because we can avoid some problems with the spam filter.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/f418me/LightningMailFaucet.git
   ```
2. Install Pyhton Packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
### Usage
Setup an LNBits Wallet and configure the script using .env file or environment variables.
You have to config the access to the wallet and the access to a Mailbox. We use a GMail Account to send the responses.
Maybe you also like to change the design and the text of mail responses.
Than just run the script in the background.

 ```sh
   nohup python ln_mail_faucet.py &
   ```
